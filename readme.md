# Kotlin practice university

Welcome to my repository of daily Kotlin exercises and code snippets taught by the university! This repository is a collection of all the Kotlin programs, assignments, and projects that I work on as part of my university coursework. The goal is to practice and reinforce the concepts taught in class, and to track my progress as I learn Kotlin.

## 📚 Course Overview
