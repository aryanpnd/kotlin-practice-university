# Kotlin Practice University

Welcome to my repository of daily Kotlin exercises and code snippets taught by the university! This repository is a collection of all the Kotlin programs, assignments, and projects that I work on as part of my university coursework. The goal is to practice and reinforce the concepts taught in class, and to track my progress as I learn Kotlin.

## 📚 Course Overview

This repository contains code examples and exercises related to the following Kotlin topics:

- **Introduction to Kotlin**: Basics, variables, data types, operators
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals, loops
- **Functions**: Declaration, parameters, return types
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Collections**: Lists, sets, maps, arrays
- **Advanced Topics**: Coroutines, higher-order functions, lambdas, etc.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by week and topic. Each folder contains:

- **Day-wise exercises**: Kotlin files (`.kt`) that correspond to the daily lessons.
- **Assignments**: More complex problems or projects that apply the concepts learned.
- **Notes**: Markdown files (`.md`) summarizing key concepts or explanations for the day's lessons.

## 🛠️ Pre-Push Hook

This repository is configured with a Git `pre-push` hook that automatically deletes all `.jar` files before pushing the code to the remote repository. This helps in keeping the repository clean by ensuring that compiled files are not accidentally committed. The hook is located in the `.git/hooks/` directory and is executed each time you run `git push`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the Kotlin code in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryanpnd/kotlin-practice-university
   cd kotlin-practice-university
   ```

2. **Open the code in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio).**

3. **Run the `.kt` files** to see the output.

## 🔄 Updates

This repository is updated daily with new exercises and code snippets, so be sure to check back regularly for the latest content!
